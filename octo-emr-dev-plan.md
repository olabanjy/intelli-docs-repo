* **MVP = ₦18.5m**
* **Post-MVP / Advanced Features = ₦14.0m**
* **Total = ₦32.5m**
* Timeline remains **~18–20 weeks**, but delivery is **value-stacked** (usable MVP early, advanced capabilities layered in).

This is aligned with the original OCTO EMR scope , but optimized for **budget realism, investor clarity, and phased go-to-market**.
