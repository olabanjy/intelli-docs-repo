## What This Document Is About

This guide explains how users access AFCON matches through our web promo links. We'll cover the different experiences users might have and why those differences exist.

**No technical jargon - just clear explanations of what happens from a user's perspective.**

---

## How Users Get to Watch AFCON

When a user clicks a promo link (from WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS, etc.), our system needs to:

1. **Identify the user** - Get their phone number
2. **Check subscription** - See if they're already paying for AFCON
3. **Guide them** - Either show matches (if subscribed) or help them subscribe first
4. **Deliver content** - Give them a streaming link to watch

The experience differs based on:
- ✅ Whether we can detect their phone number automatically
- ✅ Whether they already have an active AFCON subscription

---

## The 3 User Journeys

### Journey 1: Existing Subscriber (Best Experience) ⭐⭐⭐
**Who:** Users already paying for AFCON  
**Network:** On MTN data  
**Time:** ~25 seconds from click to watching  
**Steps:** Click link → Brief loading → Pick match → Watch!

### Journey 2: New Subscriber with Good Network ⭐⭐
**Who:** Users not yet subscribed  
**Network:** On MTN data (we can detect their phone automatically)  
**Time:** ~1-2 minutes  
**Steps:** Click link → Brief loading → See matches → Subscribe → Pick match → Watch!

### Journey 3: New Subscriber on WiFi ⭐
**Who:** Users not yet subscribed  
**Network:** On WiFi or weak signal (can't detect phone automatically)  
**Time:** ~3-5 minutes  
**Steps:** Click link → Brief loading → See matches → Enter phone manually → Subscribe → Pick match → Watch!

## Understanding the Technology (Simple Terms)

### What is "Header Enrichment" (HE)?
Think of it like caller ID for the internet. When someone on MTN network visits our website, MTN's network can tell us their phone number automatically - the user doesn't need to type it.

**How it works:**
- User is on MTN mobile data
- MTN network sends hidden information to our website
- We use a helper system called "MagicBox" to read this information
- MagicBox gives us the phone number
- User doesn't type anything!

### What is "MagicBox"?
MagicBox is MTN's special system that captures phone numbers from network data. Think of it as a translator between MTN's network and our website.

**Why we need it:**
- Our website can't read MTN network data directly (not yet)
- MagicBox can read it and tell us the phone number
- Every user gets sent to MagicBox first (takes ~8 seconds)
- MagicBox either succeeds (gets the phone) or fails (can't detect it)

### What is "DUI"?
DUI stands for "Direct User Interface" - it's MTN's subscription page where users pay for AFCON access.

**What happens there:**
- User enters payment details
- MTN charges their account
- Subscription activated
- User comes back to our website

**Important:** We don't control DUI - it's MTN's system, not ours.

### What is the "Skip Button"?
When users aren't subscribed yet, they see AFCON matches with a "Skip" button.

**Why it exists:**
- Some users want to pick a match before subscribing
- Some users want to subscribe first, then browse matches
- Some users want to verify/change their phone number
- It gives users control over their journey

## JOURNEY 3: New Subscriber on WiFi

### Who Has This Experience?
- Users who haven't subscribed to AFCON yet
- Users on WiFi, VPN, or weak MTN signal
- About 30-40% of users (home/office WiFi users)

### What They See

**Step 1: Click Promo Link**
User clicks link while connected to WiFi at home/office

**Step 2: Brief Loading (10 seconds)**

User sees:
- All AFCON matches displayed
- Each match with "Select" button
- **"Skip" button at bottom**
- No phone number detected yet

**Step 4: User Should Click Skip (Recommended)**

**Why skip is recommended:** If user selects a match now, they'll need to enter phone on MTN's page anyway. Better to enter it on our page first where we can help them.

**After clicking Skip:**

1. **Phone Entry Form** appears
   - Clean, simple form
   - Accepts any format:
     - 08033333333 ✅
     - 234 803 333 3333 ✅

   - Types their MTN number
   - Clicks "Verify Phone"

3. **System Validates**
   - Checks format: ✅ Valid Nigerian number
   - Checks subscription: ❌ Not subscribed yet
   - Redirects to MTN subscription page (DUI)

4. **User Subscribes**
   - Pays ₦500 on MTN page
   - Subscription activated

5. **Back to Match Selection**
   - Returns to our website
   - Sees AFCON matches again
   - **No skip button now** (already subscribed!)
   - Selects preferred match

6. **Watch Match!**
   - Streaming link generated
   - Automatic redirect to player
   - Match starts!

**Total time: ~3-4 minutes** (mostly because user types phone manually)

### Business Insights
- ⚠️ Slower journey (manual input required)
- ✅ Still converts well (users motivated by content)
- ✅ Phone validation = clean data for analytics
- 💡 Can send follow-up SMS/marketing to this number
- 🎯 Target: Reduce this group by improving MagicBox success rate

### Example Story: Meet Tunde
*Tunde is at home on his WiFi. A friend sends him a WhatsApp link to watch AFCON.*

1. Tunde clicks link (connected to home WiFi)
2. Brief loading - "Page is loading..."

## FAQs for Business Team

### Q1: Why can't we detect phone numbers for everyone?
**A:** Phone detection (header enrichment) only works when users are on MTN mobile data. When they're on WiFi, VPN, or other networks, the MTN network can't send us their phone number. That's just how mobile networks work.

**What we're doing:** We use MagicBox as a helper, but it can only work with what the network provides.

### Q2: Why do some users need to enter their phone manually?
**A:** When MagicBox can't detect the phone (WiFi users), we need users to tell us their number. This is the same as any online service asking for your phone number - we simply can't detect it automatically in all cases.

**Benefit:** We ensure accurate data and can validate the number is correct.

### Q3: What is the "Skip" button and why is it important?
**A:** The skip button lets users control their journey:
- Some want to browse matches first, then subscribe
- Some want to subscribe first, then choose carefully
- Some want to verify their phone number before proceeding

**Business benefit:** User control = better experience = higher conversion.

### Q4: Can we remove the skip button to simplify?
**A:** Not recommended. The skip button actually **improves conversion** for Journey 3 users because:
- It lets them enter phone in OUR system (where we control validation)
- It prevents confusion about entering phone twice
- It gives users a sense of control

**Data shows:** Users with choice convert better than users forced down one path.

### Q5: How long does each journey take?
- **Journey 1:** ~25 seconds (existing subscribers)
- **Journey 2:** ~1.5 minutes (new with MTN data)
- **Journey 3:** ~3-5 minutes (new with WiFi)

**Note:** Journey 3 time depends mostly on how fast user types their phone number.

### Q6: Why do users see a loading screen?
**A:** The brief loading (8-10 seconds) is MagicBox trying to detect the phone number. This happens for ALL users.

**Can we remove it?** No - it's necessary for the technology to work.

**Can we make it prettier?** Yes! We can add animations, tips, or promo messages during loading.

### Q7: What happens if a user abandons midway?
- **Before subscription:** They can click the link again and start over
- **After subscription but before selecting match:** We save their session for 1 hour
- **After selecting match:** They can't change their selection (one match per subscription)

### Q8: Can a user watch multiple AFCON matches?
**No.** The AFCON product allows one match selection per subscription. After selecting, the subscription is "consumed."

**Why?** This is the product design - one subscription = one match access.

**If they want more:** They need to subscribe to a multi-match package (different product).

### Q9: What's the difference between AFCON and other products (PremiumFour, Flexiwatch)?
**AFCON:** User must select a specific match (requires selection page)

**Other products:** User gets immediate access to all content (no selection needed)

**Journey difference:** Other products skip the match selection step entirely.

### Q10: How does this work with marketing campaigns?
**For best results:**
- **Mobile-first campaigns:** Target Journey 1 & 2 (better conversion)
- **WiFi campaigns:** Expect Journey 3 (lower conversion, but still works)
- **Existing subscriber campaigns:** Journey 1 (focus on engagement, not acquisition)

**Tracking:** We can track which journey each user took for campaign optimization.

### Q11: What if DUI (MTN subscription page) is down?
**A:** Users can't complete subscription. This is outside our control - DUI is MTN's system, not ours.

**Mitigation:**
- Show clear error message
- Save user's progress (if possible)
- Let them try again later
- Provide support contact

### Q12: Can we make Journey 3 faster?
**Possible improvements:**
1. Better phone input UX (auto-format, suggestions)
2. Social login (if MTN allows)
3. Remember returning users
4. Progressive web app (PWA) for faster loading

**Current focus:** Optimize what we control (our pages), accept what we don't (MagicBox, DUI).

## Summary for Leadership

### The Big Picture
We have a solid web promo flow that handles 3 different user scenarios:

1. ✅ **Existing subscribers:** Lightning fast experience (25 sec)
2. ✅ **New subscribers on mobile:** Quick and smooth (1.5 min)
3. ✅ **New subscribers on WiFi:** Requires manual input but still converts (3-5 min)

### Key Strengths
- ✨ Automatic phone detection for 60-70% of users (MTN data users)
- ✨ Graceful fallback when detection fails (manual input)
- ✨ User control with skip button (better UX = better conversion)
- ✨ Works for both new and existing subscribers
- ✨ Mobile-first design (optimized for phones)

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ WiFi users must type phone manually (can't auto-detect)
- ⚠️ We depend on external systems (MagicBox, DUI) - can't control their performance
- ⚠️ Journey 3 slower than Journey 1 & 2 (expected, acceptable)

### Business Metrics to Track
1. **Conversion rate by journey** (which converts best?)
2. **Abandonment points** (where do users drop off?)
3. **Journey distribution** (how many users in each journey?)
4. **Time to conversion** (how long does each journey take?)
5. **Support tickets by journey** (which needs most help?)

### Recommendations
1. **Marketing:** Focus campaigns on mobile users (Journey 1 & 2 conversion)
2. **UX:** Consider loading screen improvements (branding, messaging)
3. **Analytics:** Track journey types to optimize campaigns
4. **Future:** Plan for direct header enrichment (eliminate MagicBox bounce)
